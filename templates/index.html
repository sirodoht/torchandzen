                        This program is aimed at people who want to jumpstart making a product. It’s aimed at
                        experienced programmers who know what to build and how to build.

                        You apply with a plan of what you are going to build. Your plan is like a budget. It doesn’t
                        mean it will go as planned. It does mean though that you will try to make it go as planned.

                        We think the added advantages of our program are: 1. community: building with others means
                        accountability — 2. structure: consistency is crucial to high quality work — 3. space: we think
                        having a separate space for work is important — 4. feedback: from rubberducking to quick
                        third-party feedback — 5. ethics: we’ll help you figure out the societal impact of what you’re
                        building —6. zen: we hope to contribute to your inner calmness while working.

                        PyTorch is the most popular deep learning library. Zen is a buddhist word that has come to mean
                        deep calmness and inner peace. Building a product and a company easily become extremely
                        stressful things. We aim to tackle that with morning meditation, daily community lunches, evening
                        checkouts, and many other small things that we think are meaningful.
