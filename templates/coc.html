                Purpose
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We aim to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors,
                with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are
                committed to providing a friendly, safe, welcoming environment
                for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
                ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, age.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We want to do considerably better than the average group of
                software-industry people in creating a very friendly space. We
                especially want to cater to the needs of people that are members
                of software-industry minorities.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We aim to create a friendly space in terms of it being free of
                bias and prejudice, however, we want to be open to radical ideas
                and different cultures.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We want to adopt a collective approach to create a safe and
                comfortable environment for everyone. Let’s all assume an active
                role to help foster this.
            </p>

                OK behaviour
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Let’s:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-decimal pl-6">
                <li>Participate honestly.</li>
                <li>Be considerate in our discussions.</li>
                <li>Attempt synthesis instead of conflict.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of surroundings and of fellow participants.</li>
                <li>Attempt to help if we notice someone struggling.</li>
                <li>
                    Alert members of the organising team and/or fellow community
                    members if we notice someone in distress.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold sm:font-normal my-6">
                Not OK behaviour
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Not OK behaviours includes intimidating, harassing, abusive,
                discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning speech or actions by any
                participant, regardless of their popularity and prominence.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We do not welcome semi-unfriendly responses and social cues.
                For example, it’s quite an uncomfortable feeling that one
                experiences when they ask something along the lines of “what is
                X” or “who is Y” and someone else responds with “What?! I can’t
                believe you don’t know what X is!” or "Wow! You don’t know who
                Y is?!”. Let’s all refrain from these. Asking about things one
                does not know is something we want to enable and augment as
                much as possible—not the opposite.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Not OK behaviour is absolutely not acceptable and will not be
                tolerated. Anyone asked to stop not OK behaviour is expected to
                comply immediately.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold sm:font-normal my-6">
                Notify and/or Act
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour we have
                an Incident response process that one can follow. One can also
                notify someone else, even if not sure of the acceptability or
                unacceptibility of the behaviour. We have a list of community
                members to contact at the bottom of this page.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Even if there is behaviour not outlined as unacceptable by this
                text, yet it causes uncomfortableness, please do follow the
                above.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We take this part very seriously while at the same time we want
                to act with kindness and understanding for all community
                members.
