                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Why are we doing this? In essence: we think it would be cool if
                there was a space where people can do programming for fun.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Many spaces that exist only
                accept the best, the most brilliant, the ones that will change
                the world. We are, too, fans of excellence, yet we also believe
                in space for experimentation. It is in such a playground that
                opportunities to create something worthwhile will arise.

                How to be nice
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The most important thing is to be nice. In other words, let’s
                all be kind, highly empathetic, and understanding — everything
                else will follow from there.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                It can be hard to be nice. To make communicating niceness easier
                we have codified it as much as we could! The first step is the
                <a href="/coc/" class="underline">Code of Conduct</a>.
                There, we outline what behaviour is ok and what behaviour is not
                ok. Not ok behaviour is strictly not allowed in the space we
                create.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The second step is a list of social rules. We get inspired from
                Recurse Center’s list (see
                <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules" class="underline">here</a>).
                A great example is “no feigning surprise”. Feigning surprise is
                when one acts surprised when people don’t know about something
                that they do. Eg. “what?! you've never seen any movie of
                Miyazaki?!”, or for something technical, eg. “what?! you’ve
                never fine-tuned an llm?!”. It’s hard to make a comprehensive
                list of all equally annoying things, but the above example
                should serve as an indicative one. Basically: if it's behaviour
                an average person would fine annoying, don’t do it.

                Incident response
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We have a
                <a href="/coc/">Code of Conduct</a>
                to create an space where everybody feels welcome. However,
                it might be hard to identify and respond to a situation where
                someone isn’t adhering to the Code. In whatever case, if
                you feel uncomfortable with something, please contact a member
                of the organising team.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We hope you will feel comfortable speaking to a member of
                the organising team. There is an alternative option of
                emailing
                <a href="mailto:anything@torchandzen.com" class="underline">anything@torchandzen.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In all cases, consider taking some space. Creating some distance
                between you and the person who’s engaging at potentially
                unacceptable behaviour can potentially help one see the
                issue at hand more clearly.
