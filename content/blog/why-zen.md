Making software can be stressful. Resources are always limited and resources
are always considered rare — we can’t escape living in an economy after all.
Yet can we escape stress?

This is where our quest starts. We are looking for something, maybe it's a
theory or philosophy, maybe a practice — whatever it is, our goal is to find a
way to build software in calmness.

One of the seminal books of Zen Buddhism in the West is _Zen Mind,
Beginner's Mind_, by Shunryū Suzuki, the founder of San Francisco Zen Centre
and of Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the first Zen Buddhist monastery in the
West. While reading this book, in addition to calmness and peace, I identified
many ideas and practices — more than I imagined — that I already know are
conducive to high quality software making.

> "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind
there are few."  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

The book's title refers to the fact that a beginner's mind is much more open to
new possibilities than an expert's. A beginner does not know what to expect, so
they expect anything. Yet an expert is limited. There are very few unknown
unknowns in the mind of an expert. In software, it's extremely rare that all
unknowns are known. Adding to software’s inherent complexity, our industry is
developing so fast that the beginner's mind is not only a good practice, but
possible even a required one.

> “If your practice is good, you may become proud of it. What you do is good,
but something more is added to it. Pride is extra. Right effort is to get rid of
something extra.”  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

Pride alludes to ego. Ego is correlated with lack of empathy, arrogance,
difficulty in being part of a team — all of which lead to low quality software
making.

> “If you lose the spirit of repetition, your practice will become quite
difficult.”  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

Laziness to do the same thing over and over again is sometimes hailed as the
indispensable trigger for a programmer to automate something; and thus add yet
one more tool in their inventory. However, repetition is important to any
practice and we can't deny it in software building too. Doing the same thing
once is our introduction to it; doing it twice and more is how one understands
and feels it.

> “When we say something, our subjective intention or situation is always
involved. So there is no perfect word; some distortion is always present in a
statement.”  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

The limits of language are all around us. ”There is no perfect word” — because
many times we are looking for exactly one, i.e. the name of a variable or
function.

> “If you take pride in your attainment or become discouraged because of your
idealistic effort, your practice will confine you by a thick wall.”  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

This quote presents pride and pefectionism as two poles of the same dimension.
On the one hand, we already established pride as problematic due to its
connection with ego. On the other hand, perfectionism is also problematic in
the form of discouragement due to lack of the ideal result — in a way, also
connected to ego.

> “In order not to leave any traces, when you do something, you should do it
with your whole body and mind; you should be concentrated on what you do. You
should do it completely, [..] you should burn yourself completely, like a good
bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.”  
> — Shunryū Suzuki, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_

In this last quote, Shunryū Suzuki encourages the Zen student not to leave any
trace when they are doing something. I associate this to a complete focus on
the matter at hand, so much that there is not even a self. In what we call the
state of flow, there is no self, is there? At least I don’t think I feel it.

Finally, there is something else in Zen that makes me think of software: its
commitment to simplicity and elegance. Shunryū Suzuki makes the case that Zen
is all about zazen, the meditation practice in which one just sits. No intricate
theories or abstractions, no arguments or explanations, nothing complicated;
only one thing that cannot get more obvious: just sit.

In four weeks we’ll be taking part at _Torch and Zen_ with the intention of
building high quality machine learning software while escaping stress. We’ll be
doing just that and nothing else. This might be a high bar but just like Shunryū teaches us, we
don’t plan to become discouraged if we fail to reach it.
